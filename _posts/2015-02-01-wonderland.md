I'll soon be appearing in Chicago Children's Theatre's production of <a href="http://chicagochildrenstheatre.org/wonderland" target="_blank">WONDERLAND</a>, by Rachel Rockwell and Michael Mahler. This Rock 'n' Roll Alice in Wonderland adventure is an AMAZING new show with AWESOME music. I was in a workshop of it 2 years ago and I'm so excited to be part of its first run. Come check it out!
